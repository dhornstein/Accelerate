<!-- We want you to be able to finish this prep assignment before starting your course. This assignment serves as a test for your understanding on the preps materials.
Please create a standalone one-page HTML about-me site for yourself. This site consists of two part: An introduction of yourself and a photo album.
We will check you assignment on the first day of the bootcamp.
 
An Introduction to Yourself
You can talk about  anything interesting about you as you wish. We always want to know more!
Possible topics are: Hobbies, Dream, funny experiences etc.
Please make it detail and nice-looking. (You could use this as your personal site in the future!)
You are allowed and encouraged to use any technology included in this prep course.  HTML, CSS and JS are definitely useful.  
Bootstrap and JQuery are also encouraged to be used for advance effect.

A photo album of your pictures
Please include some photos that are about you or you found interesting to be shared.
The photo album should be written from scratch by yourself.
The photo album should support ***basic pagination***. 
JQuery and Bootstrap helps a lot for this task.

A Readme for your about-me page written in ***Markdown***
Markdown's syntax is very similar to wiki syntax.
You should include what is inside your about-me site.
You are also expected to explain your implementation.-->

                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p1>Hi everyone! Welcome to my very first webpage.<br><br>
                        You'll have to forgive this very basic 1.0 version. In this version, I've attempted to use my very raw HTML and CSS skills and have been encouraged through several YouTube videos to utilise CSS Grids as of which I've built my photo album out of.
                        <br><br>
                        The other purpose of this page is to tell you a little bit about myself...so sitback, relax, read and enjoy.
                        <br><br>
                        [Quick final note: at the very end of this page because I'm still learning I've put a "Web Defect Log" which is basically a culmination of things I do not like and want to change about my webpage.]
                        </p1>

                    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                    <p1>I really enjoy learning languages. As a matter of fact, I would call my intermediate in Spanish and begginer in Mandarin. I've created a little table below to highlight similar sentences across three languages.</p1>

                        <h2>New Zealand</h2>
                            <p1>As you may or may not know, I'm from the tiny island country of New Zealand. Us Kiwis are a very proud nation of around 4.5 million people -- so that's approximately half the size of Hong Kong.
                                One of our oldest traditions which stemmed from the ancient Maori tribes is a "haka" or in English it's commonly known as a war dance. The haka is primarily used as both a greeting and to set a challenge 
                                to an opposition. The below inset video is a haka performed by the All Blacks who are New Zealand's top rugby team. This particular haka in the video is called "Kapa O Pango" and it is a relatively
                                new haka only being performed for the first time in 2005 whereas the original haka "Ka Mate" has been performed since 1820.

                            <p1>To give you an idea of my hometown, Christchurch linked below is a city of around 450,000 people. Yes, tiny! I think LKF has more people in the bars on a Friday and Saturday night than the entire population
                                of my home town. Christchurch is situated in the provivence of Canterbury which is the largest province in the South Island of New Zealand.

                                <li>The title is a bit bland. I need to understand how to vertically center text as in its current position it looks a bit weid</li>
                                <li>The pixel size differential between h2 and h3 is a bit strange. I've turned h3 into 20px and it looks way too small but at 25px it is almost identical to h2. Needs beautifying.</li>
